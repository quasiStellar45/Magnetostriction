# Miscellaneous
This folder contains some code used to plot some lab data, field data, and data extracted from plots. The code in this folder is:

<ul>
  <li>Mag_data_analysis.ipynb : Contains code used to analyze DMS fiber data acquired in the TEM experiments.</li>
  <li>spectrum_timedomain_plots.ipynb : This code was used to plot DMS fiber data obtained in the laboratory experiments.</li>
  <li>Paper_plot_converter.ipynb : This code creates plots of Ms and $\alpha$ dependence on temperature.</li>
</ul>

Mag_data_analysis.ipynb and spectrum_timedomain_plots.ipynb require [DASCore](https://dascore.org/) to run.
