# Magnetostriction
A collection of code to describe magnetostrictive responses of ferromagnetic materials.

The goal of this repository is to determine what the strain signal will look like from a magnetostrictive material when positioned inside the sheathing of a fiber optic cable and placed in an alternating magnetic field. The folders in this repository include:

<ul>
  <li>2D_model: contains code used for two-dimensional modeling.</li>
  <li>3D_model: contains code used for three-dimensional modeling.</li>
  <li>application_sim: contains code used for simulations of potential applications of the DMS fiber.</li>
  <li>misc: contains code used for some plotting in the thesis.</li>
</ul>
